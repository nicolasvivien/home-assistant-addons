# Home Assistant Add-on: GandiDNS

This add-on helps you to keep your public IP and your domain name dns zone synchronized.
In order to use this add-on, you need a domain name registered at Gandi.net and your API key from Gandi.

Forked from https://github.com/benlbrm/home-assistant-addons in order to use another Gandi API than the original addon so that only the A rrset_type record is updated instead of all records for a given rrset_name.
